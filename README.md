Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to interact with users. It can perform various tasks such as :

1)Greeting users based on the time of day

2)Searching Wikipedia for information

3)Opening websites like YouTube, Google, and StackOverflow

4)Playing music from a local directory

5)Telling the current time

6)Opening a code editor

7)Sending emails to specific recipients

This project uses the following libraries: pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for speech recognition, wikipedia for searching Wikipedia, webbrowser for opening websites, os for interacting with the file system, and smtplib for sending emails.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to add more features to Jarvis!
